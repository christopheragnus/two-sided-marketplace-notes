## Planning

Planning should be done in roughly the order of the below sections.

### Project Management

[Trello](https://trello.com/) is a fantastic and free project management tool. Some examples of Trello boards used for app development and many other things: [Project Management with Trello](https://trello.com/inspiration/project-management).

Start using Trello (or the project management tool of your choice) from the very start. Plan before you do! Plan your planning (i.e. everything else in this section) too.

### Documentation

The README.md file should contain all of your documentation. This should include:

* Problem definition and solution
* User stories
* Workflow diagram
* Style guide
* Wireframes
* ERD
* Link to deployed website
* Notes on future development / project improvements
*

***Always*** insert actual images rather than giving just links, because links can go wrong, images are there forever (it's version control!).

The readme is written in markdown format. Here's a link on how to do everything you'll need to in markdown: [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

**Resources:**
* [Create TOC for README.md](https://github.com/ekalinin/github-markdown-toc)
* [Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)

### Version Control

Git & GitHub. Set them up as soon as you have created your app.

**Resources:**
* [Try Git](https://try.github.io/levels/1/challenges/1) - beginner level
* [Codecademy's Learn Git](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-git) - beginner level
* [Learn Git Branching](https://learngitbranching.js.org/) - beginner level (visual / interactive)
* [Pro Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2) - beginner / intermediate / advanced level (detailed)

### Problem Definition & Solution

What is the problem that you have identified? Justify that it's a problem. How will you provide a solution to this problem? E.g. from [The Book Place](https://github.com/biancapower/the_book_place/blob/master/README.md#problem-definition-and-solution).

### Sign Up for Web Services

### User Stories

Write lots of user stories from the perspectives of all potential users. E.g. both from sellers and from buyers.

## Implementation

The below sections are in no particular order.

### Postgresql database

Use Postgresql from the start, generating your new rails app with the following command:  ```rails new extragram --database postgresql```

Note: you may want to add additional options such as  ```--skip-active-storage```

**Resources:**

* [Getting started with Postgresql](https://www.codementor.io/engineerapart/getting-started-with-postgresql-on-mac-osx-are8jcopb) - Focus on "getting started" part 2.

### Authentication & Authorization

**Resources:**

* [Devise - getting started](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise#getting-started)
* [Devise wiki](https://github.com/plataformatec/devise/wiki)
* When in doubt, google "devise" and what you want to achieve, e.g. "devise log in using facebook"

### Payments

Start by getting Stripe Checkout fully functional in your application. Only once that is the case should you begin implementing Stripe Connect.

* [Stripe Connect - how to by Scott](https://medium.com/@scottdixon/third-party-payouts-with-stripe-connect-d3a7c0d1bcb)

Deploy early, deploy often. Do your first deployment as soon as you have created your application.
